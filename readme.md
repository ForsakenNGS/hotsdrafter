# Hots Drafter

This tool provides a simple way to use various drafting- and talent-suggestion sites 
and takes away the manual input by detecting the current draft/hero from screenshots.

It is still under heavy development, which means features can break between versions
and it is not guaranteed to work in any way or form.
